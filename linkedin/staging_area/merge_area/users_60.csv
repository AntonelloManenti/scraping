Dopo una laurea magistrale in Arti, Patrimoni e Mercati èpresso l'università IULM di Milano, ho approfondito sul campo le mie competenze di comunicazione e social media marketing. Ho curato campagne Google ADS, svolto attività di SEO/SEM per migliorare il posizionamento di siti web nei motori di ricerca, ho svolto attività di content marketing, gestito interamente un e-commerce e ho svolto artività di ufficio stampa per importanti eventi nazionali.

Sono una persona molto attiva e piena di interessi, dalla musica (suono il sax), al cinema (ho collaborato con un'organizzazione di festival di cortometraggi) allo sport (nel tempo libero amo tenermi in forma).

Ho partecipato a fiere nazionali e internazionali in differenti settori: dall'alimentare all'ambito artistico-cinematografico operando per promuovere aziende, servizi o festival.
